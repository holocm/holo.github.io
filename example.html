        <h1>How does Holo configure systems?</h1>
        <p>Holo users ship configuration in packages, usually called &quot;holograms&quot;. These can be built with the regular package building tools (debuild, rpmbuild, makepkg, etc.) or with Holo's own <a href="https://github.com/holocm/holo-build">holo-build</a> tool that offers a much more pleasant syntax and process. Let's go through an example hologram that installs and starts an OpenSSH server and tweaks some of its configuration.</p>
        <h2>The package declaration</h2>
        <p>Package declarations for holo-build are <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a> files.</p>
        <pre>[package]
name        = "hologram-openssh"
version     = "1.0.0"
description = "Start and configure OpenSSH"
requires    = ["openssh"]</pre>
        <p>Packages can install files, directories and symlinks. For example, we may want to start SSH only after the firewall is set up, so we create a configuration file for systemd.</p>
        <pre>[[file]]
path    = "/etc/systemd/system/sshd.service.d/hardened.conf"
content = """
  [Unit]
  After=firewall.service
"""</pre>
        <p>We also want to disable password authentication. This one is a bit more tricky: We want to modify the configuration installed by the OpenSSH package, but the configuration is also a package, so it may not install the same file path. Instead, we install a script that Holo will later find and execute to update the default configuration.</p>
        <pre>[[file]]
path    = "/usr/share/holo/files/10-openssh/etc/ssh/sshd_config.holoscript"
mode    = "0755"
content = """
  #!/bin/sh
  # stdin has the default config and stdout wants the updated config;
  # we just add a line at the bottom
  cat
  echo "PasswordAuthentication no"
"""</pre>
        <p>Any file below <strong>/usr/share/holo</strong> will imply a dependency on the <strong>holo</strong> package.</p>
        <p>When everything is set up, we start the daemon:</p>
        <pre>[[action]]
on     = "setup"
script = """
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl enable sshd
  systemctl restart sshd
"""</pre>
        <h2>Rolling it out</h2>
        <p>Once the package declaration is complete, a system package (.deb, .rpm, etc.) can be produced by <a href="https://github.com/holocm/holo-build">holo-build</a>. No extra tools needed.</p>
        <pre>$ holo-build --debian hologram-openssh.pkg.toml</pre>
        <p>Since we had files below <strong>/usr/share/holo</strong>, Holo will be installed as a dependency and <strong>holo apply</strong> will be executed during installation:</p>
        <pre># dpkg -i hologram-openssh_1.0.0-1_any.deb
...
Working on file:/etc/ssh/sshd_config
  store at /var/lib/holo/files/base/etc/ssh/sshd_config
  passthru /usr/share/holo/files/10-openssh/etc/ssh/sshd_config.holoscript
...</pre>
        <p>This tells us that the default configuration has been modified as described by our holoscript. And indeed:</p>
        <pre>$ tail -n1 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication no</pre>
        <h2>Monitoring for changes</h2>
        <p>When Holo provisions an entity (such as this config file), it will always store a <strong>base image</strong> describing the original state of the entity. If the entity is changed afterwards, Holo will be able to detect this change:</p>
        <pre># sed -i '/PasswordAuthentication/ s/no/yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# holo apply

Working on file:/etc/ssh/sshd_config
  store at /var/lib/holo/files/base/etc/ssh/sshd_config
  passthru /usr/share/holo/files/10-openssh/etc/ssh/sshd_config.holoscript

    +PasswordAuthentication yes</pre>
        <h2>But wait, there's more!</h2>
        <p>With <strong>plugins</strong>, Holo can be taught to provision other things than files. For example, there are plugins for <a href="https://github.com/holocm/holo-users-groups">user accounts, groups</a> or <a href="https://github.com/holocm/holo-ssh-keys">SSH public keys</a>. You can easily write your own plugins; they can be as small as <a href="https://github.com/holocm/holo/blob/master/cmd/holo-run-scripts">one shell script</a>.
        <p>This example has demonstrated the holo-files plugin that ships with the <strong>holo</strong> tool itself, but it can only scratch the surface. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/holocm/holo/tree/master/doc/">man pages</a> for the full documentation. And don't forget to <a href="./install.html">install Holo</a> on your system, too.</p>
