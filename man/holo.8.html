    <section><h1>NAME</h1><p>holo - minimal configuration management</p><h1>SYNOPSIS</h1><p>holo <strong>apply</strong> [<em>-f|--force</em>] [<em>selector</em> ...]</p><p>holo <strong>diff</strong> [<em>selector</em> ...]</p><p>holo <strong>scan</strong> [<em>-s|--short|-p|--porcelain</em>] [<em>selector</em> ...]</p><p>holo <strong>selectors</strong></p><p>holo <strong>help</strong></p><p>holo <strong>version</strong></p><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1><p>Holo adds a few sprinkles on top of package management to make it suitable for basic configuration management tasks. Its prime directive is to have all configuration statically declared and defined within packages, which can be installed to add new configuration, or uninstalled to remove configuration from a system.</p><p>Package management already offers 99% of the needed tools: Metapackages (usually called &#34;holograms&#34; or &#34;holodecks&#34; in Holo) can pull in other packages as dependencies, thus installing the software required for a certain task, and contain their own files to configure the software installed. Holo adds tools that work around shortcomings (from the configuration management perspective) of the package management.</p><h2>Plugins</h2><p>The <code>holo</code> binary is only a frontend to find and run Holo <strong>plugins</strong>. Each Holo plugin adds logic to provision a certain type of thing that package management cannot do by itself. Please refer to <span style="color:red">Unknown node type L</span> for how to discover and enable plugins.</p><p>Included with Holo is the <span style="color:red">Unknown node type L</span> plugin that allows holograms to replace or modify the default configuration files installed by application packages, the <span style="color:red">Unknown node type L</span> plugin for provisioning <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, and the <span style="color:red">Unknown node type L</span> plugin which provisions user accounts and groups to the standard <span style="color:red">Unknown node type L</span> and <span style="color:red">Unknown node type L</span> databases.</p><h2>Entities, resource files</h2><p>Holo calls the things that it works on <strong>entities</strong>. Each entity belongs to a certain plugin, since plugins contain all the logic for discovering and working on entities.</p><p>Entities are defined in <strong>source</strong> or <strong>resource files</strong> which configuration packages install into the resource directory of the corresponding plugin (at <code>/usr/share/holo/$PLUGIN_ID</code>). Depending on how the plugin works, a single entity may have multiple resource files, or a single resource file might define multiple entities.</p><p>Each entity is identified by a name, usually of the form <code>type:identifier</code>. Refer to the manpage of each plugin for the format for its entities&#39; names.</p><p>An entity that was created and still exists, but for which all source files have been removed, is said to be <strong>orphaned</strong> or an <strong>orphan</strong>. Orphaned entities are removed the next time an apply operation is performed on them.</p><h2>Generated resource files</h2><p>Sometimes, resource files cannot be supplied in a package because their existence or contents depend on state not known at package build time, e.g. the set of devices present on the final system or the system&#39;s network environment. In this case, the configuration package can supply a <strong>generator</strong> that produces the correct set of resource files when Holo runs.</p><p>The interface for generators is described in <span style="color:red">Unknown node type L</span>.</p><h1>OPERATIONS</h1><p>All operations act on all entities by default, but can be restricted to certain entities by giving <strong>selectors</strong> on the command line. A selector can be either an entity name (such as <code>file:/etc/sddm/sddm.conf</code>), or the path to a resource file that defines this entity (such as <code>/usr/share/holo/files/40-desktop/etc/sddm/sddm.conf</code>), or a plugin ID (such as <code>files</code>). A plugin ID as selector matches all entities known to that plugin.</p><p>For resource files produced by a generator, additional valid selectors include the path to the generator (such as <code>/usr/share/holo/generators/foo.sh</code>), or a pseudo-path of the form <code>$GENERATOR_PATH::$RESOURCE_REL_PATH</code> (such as <code>/usr/share/holo/generators/foo.sh::files/40-desktop/etc/sddm/sddm.conf</code>).</p><span style="color:red">Unknown node type over-text</span><h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1><span style="color:red">Unknown node type over-text</span><h1>FILES</h1><span style="color:red">Unknown node type over-text</span><p>For each plugin:</p><span style="color:red">Unknown node type over-text</span><h1>SEE ALSO</h1><p><span style="color:red">Unknown node type L</span></p><p><span style="color:red">Unknown node type L</span> can optionally be used in conjunction with Holo to simplify the package build process.</p><h1>AUTHOR</h1><p>Stefan Majewsky</p><p>Further documentation is available at the project homepage: https://holocm.org</p><p>Please report any issues and feature requests at GitHub: https://github.com/holocm/holo/issues</p></section>
